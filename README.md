🧠 Student Mental Health & Well-being Dashboard – 2025

I’m excited to share my latest **Power BI Dashboard**, designed for **analyzing the mental health trends and stressors among students globally**. 🌍

This project focuses on identifying the correlation between **lifestyle habits, academic pressure, and mental well-being**.


📂 Dataset Used  <a href ="https://github.com/Kishangpt0708/Student_Mental_Health_Analysis_PowerBi_Dashboard/blob/main/Student_Mental_Healt_Analysis_Exce.xlsx">Dataset View </a>
(Contains data on Demographics, Sleep Habits, Physical Activity, Anxiety/Depression Levels, and Counseling Access)



🔑 Key Insights at a Glance

✅ **Lifestyle Impact:** Correlation between **Sleep Hours** and **Anxiety Levels** (Do students who sleep <5 hours have higher anxiety?).

✅ **Academic Pressure:** Comparison of **Depression Risk** across different **Academic Levels** (Undergraduate vs. PhD) and **Study Fields**.

✅ **Trigger Analysis:** Identifying the top reasons for stress (e.g., **"unclear goals"**, **"peer pressure"**, **"financial stress"**).

✅ **Support Systems:** Analysis of the gap between **Counseling Access** (Availability) vs. **Sought Help** (Actual usage).

✅ **Demographic Trends:** Mental health scores broken down by **Gender** and **Country** (USA, India, Russia, etc.).

This dashboard includes:

* **Interactive Scatter Charts** showing the relationship between Sleep Hours and Mood Score.
* **Dynamic Slicers** to filter data by **Study Field**, **Country**, and **Gender**.
* **Geospatial Maps** highlighting regions with the highest average "Risk Score".
* **DAX Measures** calculating the "Average Risk Score" and "Counseling Utilization Rate".
* **Decomposition Tree** to analyze the root causes (Reasons) of high anxiety levels.

It helps educational institutions and policymakers **understand student needs** and prioritize mental health resources.


🛠 Tools & Skills Used* **Microsoft Power BI** (Dashboarding & Visualization)
* **Power Query** (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (Calculated measures for Risk and Averages)
* **Data Modeling** (Connecting demographic data to health metrics)
* **Interactive Navigation** (Drill-throughs and Tooltips)


🎯 Project Highlights* **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive analysis of the calculated **"Risk Score"** using conditional formatting.
* **Awareness Gap:** Visualizing how "Mental Health Awareness" (High/Medium/Low) affects the decision to seek help.
* **Holistic View:** Combining physical health metrics (Sleep, Exercise) with psychological metrics using a Star Schema model.
